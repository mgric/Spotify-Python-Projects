Spotify-Python-Projects
=======================

Projects done in python using spotipy wrapper and spotify api

All projects use the Spotipy Api wrapper. This simplifies the code. 
Many of the projects require a client id, a client secret id, and a redirect URI. 
These have been stripped form each program  in order to protect my applications.
Each project's applications are listed below.
