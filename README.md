Spotify-Python-Projects
=======================

Projects done in python using spotipy wrapper and spotify api

All projects use the Spotipy Api wrapper. This simplifies the code. 
Many of the projects require a client id, a client secret id, and a redirect URI. 
These have been stripped form each program  in order to protect my applications.
Each project's applications are listed below.

The first project here is a simple csv to spotify playlist.
It prompts the user for a playlist name and creates a playlist out of the songs in the csv.
